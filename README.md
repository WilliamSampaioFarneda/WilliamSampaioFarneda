# 1. How to create a Chrome Extension
Hello there, when you are going to my code you will learn how to easy 
develop a Chrome extension to a currency exchange. 
# 2. How I create the HTML
I have used a simple HTML syntax with a heading where I include my js 
file, and a body where I could use the ID to call the currency that I 
desire to exchange and know the value in dollars.

# 4. About my project
I have decided to do a Chrome extension as part of my final project due to 
the simplicity but effectiveness. I am new to coding and that was a 
challenge, At the end I spent hours watching tutorials I was able to 
accomplish the basic task of having a Chrome extension that works in real 
time. 
The JavaScript was a challenge to figure out how to add the event listener as I 
was getting an error at line 9 of my code, Later I found out that 
adding the 'DOMContentLoaded' it helped that the code could be executed 
truly and efficently.
